# Description
This branch contains the simulated operation of a greenhouse where various sensors are present. The mentioned sensors regularly produce measurements at defined time intervals, which require monitoring and management in case of critical values.

# Requirements
To properly execute this project, be sure to meet the following requirements:
- **OS**:
    - Windows (32-bit or 64 bit)
    - macOS
    - Linux (Arch, Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora, Gentoo, RHEL/CentOS, SUSE)
- **QEMU**: You must have QEMU installed on your system. You can download the latest version from [official QEMU website](https://www.qemu.org/download/).
- [**arm-none-eabi-gcc compiler**](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/gnu-rm) and **GNU make utility** must be installed on your system

# How to Run
## for Linux enviroment
Exclusively the first time, in order to install QEMU and all of its dependecies, run the following command (from the project directory):
```shell
./install.sh
```

Then, whenever you want to compile and start the QEMU emulator to run the code, simply open a terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command:
```shell
./compileProject.sh
```

## for Windows/MacOS
Start QEMU with the following command line, replacing **[path-to]** with the correct path to the project.out file generated by the GCC build.
```shell
qemu-system-arm -machine mps2-an385 -cpu cortex-m3 -kernel [path-to]/project.out -monitor none -nographic -serial stdio
```
